<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>I am a highly productive data engineer and software engineer with 18 years of
relevant experience.</p>
<p>I pride myself in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating resilient, maintainable, integrous data pipelines and products
    (ETL/ELT batch, micro-batch, and streaming for both OLAP and OLTP
    databases/lake houses/data lakes/data warehouses) for "big data",
    master data, fact data and dimensional data</li>
<li>Authoring elegant, bulletproof, type-annotated, well-formed, thoroughly
    tested, distributable Python libraries, CLIs, asynchronous micro-services
    (web APIs), and SDKs</li>
<li>Designing efficient, maintainable, testable, continuously integrated
    and deployed, modern software systems (CI/CD, Test-driven development)</li>
<li>Planning development work with clarity, flexibility, parallel execution,
    and collaboration in mind (whether using Agile or waterfall)</li>
<li>Leading engineering teams with complex and ambiguous directives towards
    clear, executable road maps</li>
<li>Condensing fact from the vapor of nuance while maintaining traceability and
    continuity with data provenance, and facilitating data governance</li>
<li>Utilizing "AI" and machine learning tools and frameworks <em>selectively</em>,
    <em>prudently</em>, and with traceability and long-term <em>cost efficacy</em> in mind</li>
<li>Infrastructure as Code: Terraform</li>

-   I lead engineering of the Nike Product & Materials Sustainability Index
    with data products published in Nike's "Sole" Databricks Platform
    (Lakehouse/Deltalake/Unity Catalog),
    Snowflake, and (prior to 2023) S3 + hive/presto + EMR. We utilized Spark,
    Python (applications and libraries, distributed through JFrog Artifactory),
    ASGI Microservices (Python + FastAPI + SQLAlchemy +
    Alembic), Apache Kafka (as a publisher), and AWS Aurora PostgreSQL.
    CI/CD using Jenkins and Github Actions, Terraform for
    Infrastructure as Code.
    This entailed design and implementation of systems for distilling
    material manufacturing process lifecycle assessment data,
    the expertise of the material scientists and sustainability professionals
    with whom we collaborated, and materials data from our product creation
    systems into data products attributing environmental impact
    measures (greenhouse gas emissions and water quality
    degradation/depletion) to Nike materials. We subsequently parsed
    product bills of material line items in order to infer material gross usage
    (way more involved than it sounds) in kilograms. Applying these measures
    to purchase order and demand planning data we were able to measure and
    track aggregate impacts for the enterprise. More importantly, we provided
    tools for product developers to reduce environmental impacts through
    better materials selection during the design process. To this end, we
    stood up micro-services (Python + FastAPI on AWS lambda) for product and
    material footprint scenario modeling.

-   I lead development of foundational data products exposing
    Environmental Health & Safety data from our 3rd-party EHS reporting system,
    Enablon (via their "Blink" OData API), in Databricks Lakehouse (Unity
    Catalog), Snowflake, and (prior to 2023) S3 + hive/presto + EMR. I used
    Spark and Python.

-   I authored enterprise CLIs (command line interfaces) and frameworks (Python
    libraries) for use in CI/CD and locally, numerous SDKs (software
    development kits) for internal and third-party platforms, extended
    SQLAlchemy and Alembic to facilitate use of ORMs
    (object relational mappings) across multiple dialects simultaneously, and
    to facilitate common and complex data frame operations in Spark, validate
    data products based on ORM metadata, securely retrieve managed credentials,
    and many other common development tasks.
