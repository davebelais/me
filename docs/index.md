## Experience

### Nike | Lead Data Engineer - Sustainability Analytics | March 2021 - June 2025

-   I lead and mentored a team of, variably, 4-8 data/software engineers in
    developing data and software products supporting analysts, data scientists,
    environmental scientists, product developers, and sustainability
    professionals in assessing and mitigating Nike's environmental impacts.
-   I implemented ELT and ETL data pipelines leveraging Databricks Delta Lake
    using Python, PySpark, Spark SQL, Snowflake SQL, and
    Amazon EMR (Python, PySpark, Spark SQL, Hadoop/HDFS and Hive/HQL)â€”employing
    patterns using batch, micro-batch, streaming (Apache Kafka and Spark) and
    Delta live tables, CDC (change data capture) from Oracle and PostgreSQL,
    and pub/sub from Amazon SQS and SNS. Overall, my redesign of Sustainability
    Analytics' data pipelines reduced compute costs by 80% as compared with
    equivalent legacy pipelines.
-   I authored Python web APIs using FastAPI and SQLAlchemy
    deployed on both AWS Lambda and Docker/Kubernetes, using Okta OAuth2
    authentication, Aurora PostgreSQL for persistence, Route 53 and
    Amazon API Gateway to route requests, deployed using Terraform for
    infrastructure-as-code to both AWS Lambda and as Docker containers
    for Kubernetes orchestration.
    This web API facilitated preemptive mitigation of environmental impacts by
    facilitating pre-manufacture scenario modeling in client product
    development systems.
-   I designed and built complete systems for calculating material
    and product footprints comprised of individually testable component python
    libraries, permitting  us to fully employ test-driven development, and
    thereby safely make use of continuous integration and deployment
    (CI/CD) with Jenkins and Github Actions, and permitting us to often
    release multiple features daily.
-   I employed dimensional modeling and type 2 slowly changing
    dimensions in our Databricks Delta Lake, Snowflake
    databases, and (prior to 2023) AWS EMR S3/hive data lake in order to
    address obstacles to replicating historically
    reported metrics which are required for regulatory audits.
-   I authored foundational data products for our Environmental Health &
    Safety data ingested from our 3rd-party EHS reporting system (Enablon)
    via their OData API into our Databricks Delta Lake, Snowflake, and
    (prior to 2023) AWS EMR + S3 + hive/presto data lake.
-   I authored enterprise developer tools including python CLIs (command line
    interfaces), libraries, and SDKs (internal and 3rd party) for CI/CD
    job deployment and orchestration on Databricks and Airflow, for
    data validation, generating data model diagrams, schema versioning and
    migration, and extending SQLAlchemy's ORM for simultaneous
    multi-dialect support and view management supporting OLAP databases
    including Databricks Delta Lake, Snowflake, and Hive and extending
    view management functionality to OLTP databases including PostgreSQL and
    SQLite.

### BICP @ Nike | Lead Data Engineer - Sustainability Analytics | March 2020 - March 2021

-   I lead and mentored a small team of 3-4 data engineers in building
    foundational data products supporting sustainability initiatives
-   I developed a Python library augmenting the SQLAlchemy dialects for
    Snowflake SQL, Databricks SQL, and Hive/HQL to support full ORM (object
    relational mapping) functionality, and to add view management
    functionality for these dialects as well as PostgreSQL and SQLite,
    in order to facilitate fully aligned multi-platform publication
    of Nike data products for all databases/data lakes supported by
    Nike Data and Analytics orgs. This facilitated seamless deployment
    and validation of data products accessible on multiple platforms.
-   I authored a framework (Python library) facilitating deployment of Nike
    ELT/ETL Spark jobs seamlessly as either an Apache Airflow DAG, Spark on AWS
    EMR job, or Spark on Databricks job, allowing us to use the most cost
    effective solution for a given scenario, and saving upwards of 90%
    on compute costs for small jobs and reducing compute time for several
    large jobs (while moderately reducing cost) from hours to minutes.
-   I authored a Python library abstracting and applying a common interface
    (as well as aligning/adding support for date partitions and check-pointing)
    to the various file systems leveraged by Nike including S3, DBFS,
    Hadoop/HDFS, local/EBS, and Box. This foresight dramatically expedited
    subsequent platform migrations from our S3/hive data lake and Snowflake
    databases to Databricks Delta Lake.

### BICP @ Nike | Senior Data Engineer - Sustainability Analytics | January 2020 - March 2020

-   I created dimensional models for Sustainability Analytics' Snowflake
    data warehouse and Amazon EMR Hive/S3 data lake
-   I planned a Jira backlog/roadmap to integrate shadow tech developed
    as part of a contract statement of work into data products and pipelines
    aligned with Nike's enterprise data strategy and governance,
    and supportable long-term by the Nike Global Technology organization
-   I established Python + SQL exams for screening new hires to fill out
    the additional engineering roles needed for the team

### The Kroger Co. | Lead Data Engineer - Web & Digital Analytics | May 2018 - November 2019

-   I authored data products using Apache Spark (PySpark, Spark SQL) marrying
    fact, dimensional and taxonomy data we ingested from click-streams using
    Apache Kafka, enterprise system busses (in-store sales data) using
    AS2/MIME (sync and async), NoSQL databases including Apache Cassandra and
    Mongo DB, and produced data productspublished to transactional and
    analytics databases and data lakes including IBM DB2, Oracle, Netezza,
    Cloudera, Hadoop/HDFS Hive/Presto/Impala, and SQL Server. The data products
    we produced correlating in-store and digital sales, EBIDTA, sell-through,
    and pricing/promotions contributed to decisions resulting in a 56%
    increase in e-commerce sales in 2018 vs 2017, and a 67% increase in
    e-commerce sales in 2019 vs 2018.
-   I developed integrations synchronizing in-store prices and promotions from
    our ERP with Magento Commerce, developing a meta-programming library
    for auto-generating Python SDKs based on that platform's Open API
    (Swagger) schema which would later serve as the conceptual
    seed for the [`oapi`](https://oapi.enorganic.org) Python library.
-   I authored pricing feeds using Python, SQLAlchemy, and IBM DB2 resolving
    type 2 slowly changing dimensions from enterprise pricing systems for
    consumption by IBM Websphere Commerce (by way of Informatica),
    synchronizing online with in-store pricing for ~140 disparate
    sets of prices for 500,000+ SKUs frequently involving complex and
    layered promotions and application of manufacturer and store coupons.

### The Kroger Co. | Lead Data Engineer - Product Information Management | November 2013 - May 2018

-   I lead development of multi-platform transactional and analytics data
    products consolidating and normalizing dimensional, fact, and click-stream
    data from disparate subsidiary and partner systems' transactional
    databases, streaming platforms, web APIs, mainframes and system busses
    using Spark, Cloudera, Hadoop/HDFS, Hive/HQL, Presto, Netezza, IBM
    DB2, Python, SQL Server, SQLAlchemy, Apache Cassandra, Mongo DB, and AS2.
-   I engineered algorithms for scoring semi-structured data, and
    performing human-in-the loop data validation and auditing for product
    descriptions, specifications and photography acquired through trading
    partners using Python, Flask, SQLalchemy, SQL Server, and IBM DB2.
-   I established source management capabilities for identifying sourcing
    and retrieval mechanisms for ingesting augmented product information
    for digital sales channels using Python + Flask + SQLAlchemy +
    SQL Server to manage complex distributor/vendor/manufacturer relationshipsâ€”
    integrating with multiple internal ERP systems, IBM DB2 and Oracle
    data warehouses, GS1 SOAP/WSDL/XML web APIs, and XML documents from
    GDSN data pools ingested via AS2.
-   I worked with our team of digital content creators to
    capture and assess productivity metrics for authoring of product page
    and search attribution content, in order to facilitate nuanced
    accountability and identify replicable patterns employed by the most
    prolific authors. For this initiative I used Python, Pandas,
    SQL Server, Flask, and SQLAlchemy. These efforts resulted in a
    throughput increase per/author of greater than 100% every year,
    and in 2018-2019 the teams I supported boasted overall per/associate output
    greater than 7 times that of competing outsourced initiatives, while
    maintaining 30% lower error rates as determined by internal audits
    routinely performed by buyers and category managers.
-   I developed an application facilitating internal review of digital content
    for e-commerce product pages' accuracy and style utilized by stakeholders
    (buyers, planners, and category managers) using a stack including Python,
    Flask, SQLAlchemy, SQL Server, HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
