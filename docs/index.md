## Experience

### Nike | Lead Data Engineer - Sustainability Analytics | March 2021 - June 2025

<small>
**Platforms:** Databricks, Snowflake, Amazon Web Services
    (AWS - including Lambda, EMR, Aurora, IAM, Cloudformation, EC2, S3)<br/>
**Languages:** Python, SQL, Javascript<br/>
**Databases and query engines:** Databricks Lakehouse, Delta lake,
    Snowflake, Terradata, Hive, Presto, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQLite<br/>
**Applications, Services and Frameworks:** Apache Spark, PySpark, Apache Kafka,
    SQLAlchemy, Alembic, FastAPI, Terraform, Docker, Linux, Github Actions,
    Jenkins, Hadoop, Copilot<br/>
**Protocols and Specifications:** Open API (Swagger), ASGI<br/>
**Distributed File Systems:** DBFS, S3, Hadoop/HDFS
**CI/CD:** Jenkins, Github Actions
</small>

-   I lead and mentored a team of, variably, 4-8 data/software engineers in
    developing data and software products supporting analysts, data scientists,
    environmental scientists, product developers, and sustainability
    professionals in assessing and mitigating Nike's environmental impacts.
-   I implemented ELT and ETL data pipelines leveraging Databricks Delta Lake
    using Python, PySpark, Spark SQL, Snowflake SQL, and
    Amazon EMR (Python, PySpark, Spark SQL, and HQL)â€”employing patterns
    using batch, micro-batch, streaming (Apache Kafka and Spark) and Delta live
    tables, reducing compute costs by 80% as compared with equivalent legacy
    pipelines.
-   I authored Python web APIs using FastAPI and SQLAlchemy
    on AWS Lambda, using Okta OAuth2 authentication, and deployed using
    Terraform for infrastructure as code. This web API facilitated preemptive
    mitigation of environmental impacts by facilitating pre-manufacture
    scenario modeling in client product development systems.
-   I designed and built complete systems for calculating material
    and product footprints comprised of individually testable component python
    libraries, permitting  us to fully employ test-driven development, and
    thereby safely make use of continuous integration and deployment
    (CI/CD) with Jenkins and Github Actions, and permitting us to often
    release multiple features daily.
-   I employed dimensional modeling and type 2 slowly changing
    dimensions in our Databricks Delta Lake, Snowflake
    databases, and (prior to 2023) AWS EMR S3/hive data lake in order to
    address obstacles to replicating historically
    reported metrics which are required for regulatory audits.
-   I authored foundational data products for our Environmental Health &
    Safety data ingested from our 3rd-party EHS reporting system (Enablon)
    via their OData API into our Databricks Delta Lake, Snowflake, and
    (prior to 2023) AWS EMR + S3 + hive/presto data lake.
-   I authored enterprise developer tools including python CLIs (command line
    interfaces), libraries, and SDKs (internal and 3rd party) for CI/CD
    job deployment and orchestration on Databricks and Airflow, for
    data validation, generating data model diagrams, schema versioning and
    migration, and extending SQLAlchemy's ORM for simultaneous
    multi-dialect support and view management supporting OLAP databases
    including Databricks Delta Lake, Snowflake, and Hive and extending
    view management functionality to OLTP databases including PostgreSQL and
    SQLite.

**Protocols and Specifications:** Open API (Swagger)<br/>
**Distributed File Systems:** S3, Hadoop/HDFS<br/>
**CI/CD:** Jenkins, Github Actions
</small>

-   I lead and mentored a small team of 3-4 data engineers in building
    foundational data products supporting sustainability initiatives
-   I developed a Python library augmenting the SQLAlchemy dialects for
    Snowflake SQL, Databricks SQL, and Hive/HQL to support full ORM (object
    relational mapping) functionality, and to add view management
    functionality for these dialects as well as PostgreSQL and SQLite,
    in order to facilitate fully aligned multi-platform publication
    of Nike data products for all databases/data lakes supported by
    Nike Data and Analytics orgs. This facilitated seamless deployment
    and validation of data products accessible on multiple platforms.
-   I authored a framework (Python library) facilitating deployment of Nike
    ELT/ETL Spark jobs seamlessly as either an Apache Airflow DAG, Spark on AWS
    EMR job, or Spark on Databricks job, allowing us to use the most cost
    effective solution for a given scenario, and saving upwards of 90%
    on compute costs for small jobs and reducing compute time for several
    large jobs (while moderately reducing cost) from hours to minutes.
-   I authored a Python library abstracting and applying a common interface
    (as well as aligning/adding support for date partitions and check-pointing)
    to the various file systems leveraged by Nike including S3, DBFS,
    Hadoop/HDFS, local/EBS, and Box. This foresight dramatically expedited
    subsequent platform migrations from our S3/hive data lake and Snowflake
    databases to Databricks Delta Lake.
