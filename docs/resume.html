<h3>Nike | Lead Data Engineer - Sustainability Analytics | March 2021 - June 2025</h3>
<p><small>
<strong>Platforms:</strong> Databricks, Snowflake, Amazon Web Services
    (AWS - including Lambda, EMR, Aurora, IAM, Cloudformation, EC2, S3)<br/>
<strong>Languages:</strong> Python, SQL, Javascript<br/>
<strong>Databases and query engines:</strong> Databricks Lakehouse, Delta lake,
    Snowflake, Terradata, Hive, Presto, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQLite<br/>
<strong>Applications, Services and Frameworks:</strong> Apache Spark, Apache Kafka,
    SQLAlchemy, Alembic, FastAPI, Terraform, Docker, Linux, Github Actions,
    Jenkins, Hadoop, Copilot<br/>
<strong>Protocols and Specifications:</strong> Open API (Swagger), ASGI<br/>
<strong>Distributed File Systems:</strong> DBFS, S3, HDFS
</small></p>
<ul>
<li>I lead and mentored a team of, variably, 4-8 data engineers in developing
    data and software products supporting analysts, data scientists,
    environmental scientists, product developers, and sustainability
    professionals in assessing and mitigating Nike's environmental impacts</li>
<li>I implemented ELT and ETL data pipelines leveraging Databricks Delta Lake
    (Python, Spark, and Spark SQL), Snowflake (Snowflake SQL), and Amazon EMR
    (Python, Spark, HQL, and Spark SQL)—employing patterns using batch,
    micro-batch, streaming (Apache Kafka and Spark) and Delta live tables,
    reducing compute costs by 80% as compared with equivalent legacy pipelines</li>
<li>I authored Python web APIs using FastAPI and SQLAlchemy
    on AWS Lambda, using Okta OAuth2 authentication, deployed using
    Terraform for infrastructure as code, to facilitate preemptive mitigation
    of environmental impacts by facilitating pre-manufacture scenario modeling
    in product development systems</li>
<li>I designed and built our systems for calculating material
    and product footprints as individually testable component python libraries,
    permitting  us to fully employ test-driven development, and thereby
    safely make use of continuous integration and deployment
    (CI/CD) with Jenkins and Github Actions, and permitting us to often
    release multiple features daily</li>
<li>I employed dimensional modeling and type 2 slowly changing
    dimensions in our Databricks Delta Lake, Snowflake
    databases, and (prior to 2023) S3/hive data lake in order to
    address obstacles to replicating historically
    reported metrics (required for regulatory audits)</li>
<li>I authored foundational data products exposing Environmental Health &amp;
    Safety data from our 3rd-party EHS reporting system, Enablon, incrementally
    ingested via their Blink OData API, into our Databricks Delta Lake,
    Snowflake, and (prior to 2023) S3 + hive/presto data lake</li>
<li>I authored enterprise developer tools including python CLIs (command line
    interfaces), libraries, and SDKs (internal and 3rd party) for CI/CD
    job deployment and orchestration on Databricks and Airflow, for
    data validation, generating data model diagrams, schema versioning and
    migration, and extending SQLAlchemy's ORM for simultaneous
    multi-dialect support and view management supporting OLAP databases
    including Databricks Deltalake, Snowflake, and Hive/HQL</li>
</ul>

    and versioning support.</li>
<li>I authored a framework for Sustainability Analytics' ETL jobs
    incorporating end-to-end schema-based data validations, local testing, and
    environment and file system abstraction.</li>
