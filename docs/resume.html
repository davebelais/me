<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>I am a highly productive software and data engineer with 18 years of
experience, including 15 years working in complex, matrixed, enterprisef
organizations. I pride myself in authoring elegant, bulletproof,
type-annotated, well-formed, thoroughly tested, distributable Python
libraries and applications, and designing efficient, maintainable, systems
which hold up over time. I have extensive experience with Spark and
Databricks, myriad analytics and relational databases, and in building
rock-solid asynchronous web APIs.</p>
<h2>Experience</h2>
<h3>Nike | Lead Data Engineer, Sustainability Analytics | March 2021 - June 2025</h3>
<p>Data Products:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Nike Sustainability Index (Databricks Lakehouse, Snowflake, Spark, Python,
    FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Apache Kafka, AWS Lambda, AWS Aurora PostgreSQL):
    As the lead data engineer for Sustainable Products and Materials, I worked
    with material scientists and Sustainability professionals to design and
    implement the current generation of systems we use to model our scope 3
    environmental impacts, including greenhouse gas emissions. We leverage
    data from Nike's supply chain (such as bills of material, demand
    planning projections, and purchase orders) to produce scientifically
    supported, traceable, reproducible, estimates of Nike's environmental
    impact metrics (such as Kg of CO2-equivalent greenhouse gas emissions).
    This data was leveraged in the aggregate for annual reporting to
    stockholders, in more granular reporting to aid product creation in
    identifying opportunities for improvement.
    Additionally, we stood up micro-services
    (<a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/">FastAPI rocks!</a>) to provide our partners
    in product creation the means to perform scenario modeling during the
    material selection and product design process, including identification
    of functionally equivalent alternate materials to reduce Nike's impact.
    Because the lifecycle analysis data used to calculate environmental
    footprint metrics needs updated quarterly, and because footprints needed
    frequent recalculation for millions of products and hundreds of thousands
    of unique materials—we employed an atypical design which encapsulated
    these contributing 3rd party-sourced metrics, along with mapping inputs
    submitted by business users, in a versioned distributable. This represented
    a dramatic performance boost over acessing a centralized store for the
    semi-static data, and could be deployed as a dependency for both
    Databricks jobs and microservices, ensuring identical output despite
    not accessing a physical single source of truth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enablon EHS Reporting (Databricks Lakehouse, Snowflake, Spark, Python,
    SQLAlchemy, OData): I designed and built out the initial implementation of
    our foundational data ingestion pipelines and warehouse mirroring Nike's
    3rd party EHS (Environmental, Health, and Safety) tool used for reporting
    by our manufacturing partners. This data product was recently
    handed off to a newly stood-up sister squad to maintain.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Tooling and Frameworks (Python Libraries and CLIs, Github Actions):</p>
<ul>
<li>I authored command line tools and frameworks
    used in CI/CD and locally, numerous SDKs for internal and third-party
    platforms, extended SQLAlchemy and Alembic to facilitate use of ORMs
    (object relational mappings) across multiple dialects simultaneously, to
    facilitate common and complex data frame operations in Spark, to validate
    data products based on ORM metadata, securely retrieve managed credentials,
    and many other common and specialized development tasks.</li>
</ul>
<h3>BICP @ Nike | Lead Data Engineer, Sustainability Analytics | March 2020 - March 2021</h3>
<ul>
<li>Developed a SQLAlchemy-ORM-based framework for automating deployment and
    versioning (schema migration) supporting all database dialects leveraged
    by the Nike Enterprise Data &amp; Analytics organization: Databricks,
    Snowflake, Hive/Presto on S3, and PostgreSQL with full rollback
    and versioning support</li>
<li>Authored a framework for Sustainability Analytics' ETL jobs incorporating
    end-to-end schema-based data validations, local testing, and environment
    + file system abstraction</li>
</ul>
<h3>BICP @ Nike | Senior Data Engineer, Sustainability Analytics | January 2020 - March 2020</h3>
<h3>The Kroger Co. | Lead Data Engineer - Web &amp; Digital Analytics | May 2018 - November 2019</h3>

    buyers and planners correlating digital and store sales and EBITDA with
    inventory,sell-through, prices, and promotional events&#8212;contributing
    to decisions resulting in a 56% increase in e-commerce sales in 2018 vs
    2017, and a 67% increase in ecommerce sales in 2019 vs 2018</li>

    OLAP and OLTP data products to ingest, consolidate and normalize sales,

    systems' transactional databases, streaming platforms, APIs, and
