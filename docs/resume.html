organizations.</p>
<p>I pride myself in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating resilient, maintainable, integrous data products</li>
<li>Authoring elegant, bulletproof, type-annotated, well-formed, thoroughly
    tested, distributable Python libraries, CLIs, asynchronous micro-services
    (web APIs), and SDKs</li>
<li>Designing efficient, maintainable, testable, continuously integrated
    and deployed, modern software systems</li>
<li>Planning development work with clarity, flexibility, parallel execution,
    and collaboration in mind</li>
</ul>

<h2>Experience</h2>
<h3>Nike | Lead Data Engineer - Sustainability Analytics | March 2021 - June 2025</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I lead engineering of the Nike Product &amp; Materials Sustainability Index
    with data products published in Databricks Lakehouse (Unity Catalog),
    Snowflake, and (prior to 2023) S3 + hive/presto + EMR. We utilized Spark,
    Python (applications and libraries, distributed through JFrog Artifactory),
    ASGI Microservices (Python + FastAPI + SQLAlchemy +
    Alembic), Apache Kafka (as a publisher), and AWS Aurora PostgreSQL.
    This entailed design and implementation of systems for distilling
    material manufacturing process lifecycle assessment data,
    the expertise of the material scientists and sustainability professionals
    with whom we collaborated, and materials data from our product creation
    systems into data products attributing environmental impact
    measures (greenhouse gas emissions and water quality
    degradation/depletion) to Nike materials. We subsequently parsed
    product bills of material line items in order to infer material gross usage
    (way more involved than it sounds) in kilograms. Applying these measures
    to purchase order and demand planning data we were able to measure and
    track aggregate impacts for the enterprise. More importantly, we provided
    tools for product developers to reduce environmental impacts through
    better materials selection during the design process. To this end, we
    stood up micro-services (Python + FastAPI on AWS lambda) for product and
    material footprint scenario modeling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I lead development of foundational data products exposing
    Environmental Health &amp; Safety data from our 3rd-party EHS reporting system,
    Enablon (via their "Blink" OData API), in Databricks Lakehouse (Unity
    Catalog), Snowflake, and (prior to 2023) S3 + hive/presto + EMR. I used
    Spark and Python.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I authored enterprise CLIs (command line interfaces) and frameworks (Python
    libraries) for use in CI/CD and locally, numerous SDKs (software
    development kits) for internal and third-party platforms, extended
    SQLAlchemy and Alembic to facilitate use of ORMs
    (object relational mappings) across multiple dialects simultaneously, and
    to facilitate common and complex data frame operations in Spark, validate
    data products based on ORM metadata, securely retrieve managed credentials,
    and many other common development tasks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>BICP @ Nike | Lead Data Engineer - Sustainability Analytics | March 2020 - March 2021</h3>
<ul>
<li>I developed a SQLAlchemy-ORM-based framework for automating deployment and
    versioning (schema migration) supporting all database dialects leveraged
    by the Nike Enterprise Data &amp; Analytics organization: Databricks,
    Snowflake, Hive/Presto on S3, and PostgreSQL with full rollback
    and versioning support.</li>
<li>I authored a framework for Sustainability Analytics' ETL jobs incorporating
    end-to-end schema-based data validations, local testing, and environment
    + file system abstraction.</li>
</ul>
<h3>BICP @ Nike | Senior Data Engineer - Sustainability Analytics | January 2020 - March 2020</h3>
<h3>The Kroger Co. | Lead Data Engineer - Web &amp; Digital Analytics | May 2018 - November 2019</h3>
<ul>
<li>I lead development of data products distilling and exposing analytics to
    buyers and planners correlating digital and store sales and EBITDA with
    inventory,sell-through, prices, and promotional events&#8212;contributing
    to decisions resulting in a 56% increase in e-commerce sales in 2018 vs
    2017, and a 67% increase in ecommerce sales in 2019 vs 2018.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Kroger Co. | Lead Data Engineer - Product Information Management | November 2013 - May 2018</h3>
<ul>
<li>I lead development of multi-platform (Spark/Hive/Presto, Netezza, DB2,
    Python, SQL Server, SQLAlchemy)
    OLAP and OLTP data products to ingest, consolidate and normalize sales,
    dimensional, and click-stream data from disparate subsidiary and partner
    systems' transactional databases, streaming platforms, APIs, and
    mainframes.</li>
<li>I engineered algorithms for scoring semi-structured data and performing
    human-in-the loop data validation and auditing for product descriptions,
    specifications and photography acquired through trading partners (Python).</li>
<li>I established source-management capabilities for inbound data to handle
    complex retailer/vendor/manufacturer relationships (Python).</li>
<li>Collaborated with emerging digital initiatives to ensure the capture of all
    metrics needed to facilitate accountability and continuous operational
    improvement.</li>
