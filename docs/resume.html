<h2>Experience</h2>
<h3>Nike | Lead Data Engineer - Sustainability Analytics | March 2021 - June 2025</h3>
<p>Data Products:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Nike Sustainability Index (Databricks Lakehouse, Snowflake, Spark,
    Python, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Apache Kafka, AWS Lambda, AWS Aurora
    PostgreSQL):
    I led the design and implementation of systems for distilling the expertise
    of the material scientists and Sustainability professionals with whom I
    collaborated into data products attributing environmental impact
    measures, pertaining to greenhouse gas emissions and water quality
    degredation/depletion, to Nike materials, then to the products comprised of
    these materials, proportionate to gross usage. Applying these measures
    to purchase order and demand planning data we were able to measure and
    track aggregate impacts for the enterprise. More importantly, we provided
    tools for product developers to reduce environmental impacts through
    better material selection. To this end we exposed microservices
    (FastAPI on AWS lambda) for product and material footprint scenario
    modeling, in addition to our Analytics data products (Databricks Unity
    Catalog, and formerly Snowflake and Hive/Presto on S3) and Apache Kafka
    streams.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enablon EHS Reporting (Databricks Lakehouse, Snowflake, Spark, Python,
    SQLAlchemy, OData): I designed and built out the initial implementation of
    our foundational data ingestion pipelines and databases mirroring Nike's
    3rd party EHS (Environmental, Health, and Safety) tool used for reporting
    by our manufacturing partners.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Tooling and Frameworks (Python Libraries and CLIs, Github Actions):</p>
<ul>
<li>I authored command line tools and frameworks
    used in CI/CD and locally, numerous SDKs for internal and third-party
    platforms, extended SQLAlchemy and Alembic to facilitate use of ORMs
    (object relational mappings) across multiple dialects simultaneously, to
    facilitate common and complex data frame operations in Spark, to validate
    data products based on ORM metadata, securely retrieve managed credentials,
    and many other common and specialized development tasks.</li>
</ul>
<h3>BICP @ Nike | Lead Data Engineer - Sustainability Analytics | March 2020 - March 2021</h3>
<ul>
<li>Developed a SQLAlchemy-ORM-based framework for automating deployment and
    versioning (schema migration) supporting all database dialects leveraged
    by the Nike Enterprise Data &amp; Analytics organization: Databricks,
    Snowflake, Hive/Presto on S3, and PostgreSQL with full rollback
    and versioning support</li>
<li>Authored a framework for Sustainability Analytics' ETL jobs incorporating
    end-to-end schema-based data validations, local testing, and environment
    + file system abstraction</li>
</ul>

    2017, and a 67% increase in ecommerce sales in 2019 vs 2018</li>
