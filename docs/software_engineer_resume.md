## Experience

### Nike | Lead Data/Software Engineer - Sustainability Analytics | March 2021 - June 2025

<small>
**Platforms:** Databricks, Snowflake, Amazon Web Services
    (AWS - including Lambda, EMR, Aurora, IAM, Cloudformation, EC2, S3)<br/>
**Languages:** Python, SQL, Javascript<br/>
**Databases and query engines:** Databricks Lakehouse, Delta lake,
    Snowflake, Terradata, Hive, Presto, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQLite<br/>
**Applications, Services and Frameworks:** Apache Spark, Apache Kafka,
    SQLAlchemy, Alembic, FastAPI, Terraform, Docker, Linux, Github Actions,
    Jenkins, Hadoop, Copilot<br/>
**Protocols and Specifications:** Open API (Swagger), ASGI<br/>
**Distributed File Systems:** DBFS, S3, HDFS
</small>

-   I lead a team of, variably, 4-8 data engineers in developing data and
    software products supporting analysts, data scientists, environmental
    scientists, product developers, and sustainability professionals in
    assessing and mitigating Nike's environmental impacts
-   I redesigned and implemented ELT and ETL data pipelines leveraging
    Databricks Delta Lake, Snowflake, and Amazon EMR—employing batch,
    micro-batch, streaming (Apache Kafka and Spark) and Delta live tables,
    reducing compute costs by 80% as compared with legacy pipelines
-   I authored Python web APIs using FastAPI and SQLAlchemy
    on AWS Lambda, using Terraform for infrastructure as code, and OAuth2
    (Okta) for authentication, to facilitate preemptive mitigation of
    environmental impacts by facilitating pre-manufacture scenario modeling
    in product development systems
-   I designed our systems for calculating material
    and product footprints as individually testable component libraries,
    permitting  us to fully employ test-driven development, and thereby
    safely make use of continuous integration and deployment
    (CI/CD), permitting us to frequently release multiple features daily
-   I leveraged data models in our Databricks Delta Lake, Snowflake databases,
    and (prior to 2023) S3/hive data lake incorporating type 2 slowly changing
    dimensions in order to address obstacles to replicating historically
    reported metrics (required for regulatory audits)
-   I authored foundational data products exposing Environmental Health &
    Safety data from our 3rd-party EHS reporting system, Enablon (incrementally
    ingested via their "Blink" OData API), into our Databricks Delta Lake,
    Snowflake, and (prior to 2023) S3 + hive/presto data lake
-   I authored enterprise developer tools including CLIs (command line
    interfaces) and frameworks (Python libraries) for use in CI/CD and locally,
    numerous SDKs (software development kits) for internal and third-party
    platforms, extended SQLAlchemy and Alembic to facilitate use of ORMs
    (object relational mappings) across multiple dialects simultaneously, and
    to facilitate common and complex data frame operations in Spark, validate
    data products based on ORM metadata, securely retrieve managed credentials,
    and many other common development tasks

**Protocols and Specifications:** Open API (Swagger)<br/>
**Distributed File Systems:** S3, HDFS
</small>

I lead a team of data engineers in building foundational data products
supporting sustainability initiatives:

-   I developed a SQLAlchemy-ORM-based framework for automating deployment and
    versioning (schema migration) supporting all database dialects leveraged
    by the Nike Enterprise Data & Analytics organization: Databricks,
    Snowflake, Hive/Presto on S3, and PostgreSQL with full rollback
    and versioning support.
-   I authored a framework for Sustainability Analytics' ETL jobs
    incorporating end-to-end schema-based data validations, local testing, and
    environment and file system abstraction.
